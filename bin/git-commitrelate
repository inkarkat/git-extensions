Commit with the same commit message as passed revision(s) [from the working copy
that FILE or DIR resides in] as the base for further editing, referencing prior
commit(s) (when it's too late to amend the existing commit).
This just adds a reference to the prior commit(s) in the commit message (title
and body).
