    cat <<HELPTEXT
Puts a header line (unless --no-header) that contains the repo name before the
command output.
    --no-pager		Do not page the output (so contents will scroll out of
			view if there's too much output).
    --no-header		Do not output the header line before command output (and
			no separating empty line after it).
    --interactive|-i	For use with interactive COMMANDs that query the user or
			open an editor; combination of --no-pager --no-header.
    --separate-errors	Do not combine command output and command errors into
			one (paged) stream. Commands that just cause error
			output won't have a header then. Error output will
			remain on its separate file descriptor and will not be
			paged. Useful if you want to suppress errors or handle
			them separately.
    --no-git-color	Do not pass a --color=... to "git SIMPLECOMMAND". (For
			COMMANDLINE you have to insert "\${gitColorArg[@]}"
			yourself.)
    --command|-c CMD	Execute the passed command line for the superproject.
			When this is a simple Git command, it can also be passed
			as such:
			    $(basename "$1") [...] [--] SIMPLECOMMAND
Note: For paging and headers, this command has to control Git's color output.
Pass --no-git-color if "git SIMPLECOMMAND" does not support the --color=...
arguments. (For COMMANDLINE you have to insert "\${gitColorArg[@]}" yourself.)
You can still pass --color=always if you pipe this command's output yet still
want coloring of headers.
