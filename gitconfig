[alias]
	; Alternative: Do this programmatically:
	; 	git config --global alias.foo 'commit -m "foobar"'

	; Note: You cannot override a built-in Git command via an alias. Cp.
	; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538774/is-it-possible-to-override-git-command-by-git-alias
	;
	;alias = config --get-regexp 'alias\\..*' ; List all defined aliases.
	;; alias: List all Git aliases [starting with <pattern>].
	;; aliases: List all (documented) Git aliases, command extensions, and newly defined commands [starting with <pattern>].
	; Note: If you name the shell command "git-aliasname", there's no need
	; to define an alias here; Git will automatically pick it up; in fact,
	; git-aliasname takes precedence over the alias!
	;
	;alias = !git-alias
	; The following two definitions are equivalent (the second is preferred):
	;	echoalias1 = !git-echo fixed-argument
	;	echoalias2 = echo fixed-argument
	;
	; Note: You also cannot use a shell command "git-builtin" to override
	; the "git builtin" command! To achieve that, you need a custom "git"
	; shell function that intercepts the git call.
	; To do something with individual arguments, use something like this:
	;x = "!sh -c 'echo args: \"$@\"' -"
	; But I prefer defining an external git-subcommand for this.
	;
	; Note: To define a Git alias containing a semicolon, wrap the entire alias right-hand side in double quotes.

	; Handle the common typo "git git COMMAND" through my wrapper. Note: Does not handle "git git-COMMAND".
